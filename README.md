# Haiku-OS-Virtualization-and-SystemCall-Project-Description
## Documentation Description
This project provides a detailed guide to installing, configuring, and exploring 
the Haiku Operating System—an open-source OS inspired by BeOS—within a virtualized environment.
It documents the end-to-end process of setting up Haiku OS using VirtualBox or VMware, troubleshooting
common issues, understanding the Be File System (BFS), and analyzing the advantages and limitations of 
Haiku. The documentation emphasizes hands-on experimentation and real-world problem solving, making it 
suitable for students and professionals interested in system programming, OS architecture, and virtualization 
concepts. All steps are aligned with official Haiku practices for clean and efficient setups.
## System-Call Description
This project also demonstrates the use of the fork() system call in C++ within Haiku OS.
The fork() system call is essential in UNIX-like systems, including Haiku, for creating new 
processes by duplicating the current process. The implementation includes a sample C++ program 
compiled and executed within the Haiku terminal, helping learners understand memory space duplication,
PID assignment, and parent-child process behavior. This is valuable for developers exploring multiprocessing, 
process trees, and operating system internals.
